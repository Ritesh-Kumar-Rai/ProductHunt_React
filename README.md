## First download the node modules by:

```cmd
npm install
```

## Then run the project

```cmd
npm start
```

## In future Case study blog article use the following:

- How i used new Map() for faster lookups, incase i used it on reducer or to any heavy datasets; Normal arrays are good but for large datasets it's really very compute demanding and slows like O(n) or O(n^2) where new Map() shines which provides faster looks to get a specific item:

  ```js
  // In normal array we use

  array.find(); // which is O(n) or O(n^2) for each time

  // but in new Map()
  map_data.get(key_name); // O(1) faster
  ```

* UPDATE_QUANTITY handles both manual and UI-driven quantity changes.
* - If the new quantity differs from the current one, we replace it directly.
* - If the new quantity matches the current one (e.g., user clicks "+" but value is already synced),
* we increment by 1 to reflect user intent.
* This ensures responsive UX and avoids stale quantity display.

## 1. We have some points which is best to use and which used in this application

### a. ErrorBoundary: which is used to caught errors while rendering child components and render fallback ui

### b. Preloading route elements of React Router: By using Element.preload

Purpose: Improve perceived performance by loading route components before navigation.

‚úÖ When to Use
For frequently visited routes (e.g., Home, Explore).

Avoid preloading rarely visited routes (e.g., Contact, SignIn).

‚úÖ How to Preload
React lazy components support .preload() if you expose it:

```js
const Home = Object.assign(
  lazy(() => import("./pages/Home")),
  { preload: () => import("./pages/Home") }
);
```

Then in useEffect or on hover:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  Home.preload(); // preload Home route
}, []);
```

Or:

```jsx
<button onMouseEnter={() => Home.preload()}>Explore</button>
```

Edge Cases:

- If user lands directly on /product/:id, preloading won‚Äôt help.

- That‚Äôs okay‚ÄîReact will lazy-load it as usual.

- Preloading is about optimizing navigation, not replacing lazy loading.

### üåê 3. SEO with React Helmet: React-Helmet library for Injecting SEO meta tags auto.

Problem: React is a SPA, so search engines struggle to crawl dynamic content.

Solution: Use react-helmet to inject meta tags dynamically.

‚úÖ Install Helmet

```bash
npm install react-helmet-async
```

#### react-helmet-async because react-helmet is deprecated!

‚úÖ Usage in Pages

```jsx
import { HelmetProvider } from "react-helmet-async";

function App() {
  //...
  return (
    <HelmetProvider>
      // all your components and pages will render here
    </HelmetProvider>
  );
}
// wrap the all pages which uses Helmet with HelmetProvider
```

```jsx
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet-async";

function ProductPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Helmet>
        <title>Buy Premium Shoes | MyStore</title>
        <meta
          name="description"
          content="Explore premium shoes with discounts and fast delivery."
        />
        <meta name="keywords" content="shoes, ecommerce, buy online" />
      </Helmet>
      <h1>Product Details</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

`üß† Bonus Tip`

You can also create a reusable SEO.jsx component:

```jsx
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet-async";

const SEO = ({ title, description }) => (
  <Helmet>
    <title>{title}</title>
    <meta name="description" content={description} />
  </Helmet>
);

export default SEO;
```

Then use it like:

```jsx
<SEO title="Product Details" description="Buy premium shoes online." />
```

### In case, you have used default meta tags or title in index.html then add an attribute like data-rh='true', so that Helmet will override it
