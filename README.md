## ðŸš€ Tech Stack Used

- **JavaScript**
- **React Js**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Radix UI**
- **React-Router**

### Not Included:

Redux, RTK or Zustand is not included in this project, because i am testing how Context+Reducer extends to, and when this project actually demands for Advanced State management. Till now all are quiet done smoothly with Context & Reducer;

### Todo/Issues:

- In product page even the product is out of stock and total stock is zero, the user still able to add it to cart. It's a bug.

- In Explore page the Search Bar doesn't have clear/remove btn or option, will see later; & un-expectedly the explore component was re-rendering for more than 7 times which is a bottleneck of performance.. will see in future too.
