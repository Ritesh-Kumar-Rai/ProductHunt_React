# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This portfolio project is built for demonstration and learning purposes. It is not a commercial application. The site does not actively collect, store, or share personal information.

## Information Collection

- **Automatically collected data**: None. This project does not use cookies, trackers, or analytics.
- **User-provided data**: If you submit information (e.g., name, email in a demo login form), it is used only for demonstration and not stored in a database.

## Use of Information

Any data entered is used solely to demonstrate functionality (e.g., adding items to a cart). It is not shared with third parties or used for marketing.

## Third-Party Services

If this project integrates external APIs (e.g., product listings, payment gateway mock), those services may have their own privacy policies. This project does not control or manage those policies.

## Security

This project is not intended for production use. While basic security practices are followed, no guarantees are made regarding data protection.

## Changes to Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as the project evolves. Updates will be reflected here.
